# 🥗 Automated Nutrition Label Generator  
### AI-Assisted FSSAI Compliance System

---

## 📌 Overview

The **Automated Nutrition Label Generator** is a backend-focused web application that converts custom recipes into FSSAI-aligned nutrition labels using deterministic computation combined with AI-powered interpretation.

The system separates regulation-safe numeric calculations from LLM-driven insights, ensuring accuracy, compliance reliability, and intelligent recommendations.

This project demonstrates structured relational database design, clean architecture principles, and scalable backend engineering.
